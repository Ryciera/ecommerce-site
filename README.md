# ecommerce-site
An eCommerce site set in the fictional world of Acme, that uses PHP and MySql to load pages and databases, and sessions to allow login and upkeep a cart.

See it live here: http://www.rheaherrmann.com/compsci/ecommerce/login.php

This program does the following:
- Requires the user to log in or create an account.
- Displays products as user selects them.
- Holds information about all chosen items in the user's cart.
- Allows user to add or remove items from cart, remove all items from the cart, and display weights, prices, and totals.
- Allows user to eventually log out if they chose to.

# NOTE:
This sample code is not functional unless you add connections to your own database. I've omitted all connections to my database for security purposes.

This sample code will also look like crap without the templates from my website. It is not provided here to run, but simply see how it's programmed live on my page.
